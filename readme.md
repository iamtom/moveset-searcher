# Pokémon Move Finder

## What is it?
The user can choose up to four Pokémon moves and this application will find which
Pokémon, if any, can learn those moves.

Currently it will only return the names of the Pokémon however I intend to
add additional information that should be useful such as what versions the 
Pokémon can learn all the moves in.

This application uses pokeapi.co. The API is accessed using my code which can
be found here: https://github.com/iamtom/poke-api-library

The application uses Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.
