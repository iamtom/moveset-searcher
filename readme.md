# Moveset Searcher
https://moveset-searcher.onrender.com

## What is it?
The user can choose up to four Pokémon moves and this application will find which
Pokémon, if any, can learn those moves.

This application uses pokeapi.co to retrieve data about Pokémon, their moves, etc. 
The API is accessed using my code which can be found here: 
https://github.com/iamtom/poke-api-library

The application uses Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

## Why?
I wanted to learn about using Spring Boot and at the same time I wanted to make 
an application that I myself would find useful. Also choosing Pokémon as the 
thing to base it around meant I was working with data that was already very 
familiar to me from having played the games.

## Future Plans
I will be adding a way for the application to show the user what versions the
Pokémon can learn these moves in.
